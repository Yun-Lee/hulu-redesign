# hulu-redesign
A project inspired by Brad and my dad, who always rely on my assistant to use app and website (I'd love to tho). However, it makes me wonder that there must be a way to design a more elderly friendly web page.

I delpoyed the project website using AWS S3 service (free trial), it's an awesome tool to deploy your own static website, feel free to view the page via https://www.hulu.com/welcome?orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F
